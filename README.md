1. Project Overview: The SEBI Porƞolio Managers Data Scraping project aimed to
collect and analyse data from the SEBI website to gain insights into the performance
of 512 porƞolio managers for June 2024. Using Python-based web scraping
techniques, the data was extracted, processed, and structured in Excel to facilitate
further analysis. The project's primary focus was to ensure accurate data extracƟon
and meaningful organizaƟon for beƩer decision-making.
2. Tech Stack Used
 Python: Employed for automaƟng web scraping and data extracƟon.
 Excel: Used for data structuring, analysis, and calculaƟons.
3. Data Overview
 Source: SEBI Website (SEBI Porƞolio Managers)
 Scope: Data for 512 porƞolio managers, each with 112 columns detailing
various performance and operaƟonal metrics.
4. Methodology
Web Scraping Process:
1. Python Libraries Used:
o BeauƟfulSoup for HTML parsing
o requests for fetching web content
o pandas for data manipulaƟon
2. Steps Taken:
o Accessed the SEBI website and navigated to the relevant data page.
o Extracted 112 aƩributes for each porƞolio manager.
o Structured and stored the data in an Excel file for further processing.

Data OrganizaƟon and Processing:
1. Formaƫng:
o The raw data was cleaned and organized into a tabular structure.

o Duplicate entries and missing values were idenƟfied and handled
appropriately.
2. Sheet CreaƟon:
o Separate sheets were created for raw data, analysis, and summary
reports.

3. VLOOKUP and CalculaƟons:
o Implemented VLOOKUP to extract key informaƟon efficiently.
o Performed staƟsƟcal calculaƟons to idenƟfy trends and paƩerns in the
data.
5. Analysis and Insights
Key Findings:
 Performance Trends:
o A significant variance in porƞolio returns was observed across different
managers.
o Top-performing managers demonstrated consistent growth paƩerns,
while others showed volaƟlity.

 Asset DistribuƟon:
o Analysis indicated that a large proporƟon of porƞolio managers focused
on equity-based investments.
o Debt instruments and hybrid porƞolios were found to have lower
representaƟon.
 Compliance and ReporƟng:
o Some inconsistencies were noted in reported data, indicaƟng a need for
improved regulatory compliance.

 Risk Assessment:
o A correlaƟon analysis highlighted potenƟal risk factors affecƟng the
returns of porƞolio managers.

6. Conclusion: This project successfully automated the data extracƟon process,
enabling efficient organizaƟon and analysis of SEBI porƞolio manager data. The

structured insights derived from the project can assist stakeholders in making
informed decisions regarding investment strategies and regulatory compliance.
7. Future Enhancements
 AutomaƟon:
o Implement periodic data scraping to ensure real-Ɵme updates.
 Advanced AnalyƟcs:
o UƟlize machine learning models for predicƟve analysis of porƞolio
performance.
 VisualizaƟon:
o Develop interacƟve dashboards for beƩer data representaƟon and
trend idenƟficaƟon.

By leveraging Python for data extracƟon and Excel for analysis, this project sets the
foundaƟon for enhanced financial data management and insights generaƟon
